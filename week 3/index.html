<h1>👩‍💻👨‍💻 Hello Software Engineers — Week 3! 🌊</h1>

<p>
	Welcome back! Last week you explored advanced JavaScript — including working with JSON data and powerful array methods like <code>map()</code>, <code>filter()</code>, <code>find()</code>, and <code>reduce()</code>.
	This week, you’ll see how those same skills come alive inside <strong>React components</strong> ⚛️.
</p>

<p>
	We’ll use arrays to render lists of students and surf forecasts dynamically in JSX — using <code>{'{ }'}</code> to embed JavaScript expressions directly inside HTML-like code.
</p>

<p>
	If this feels new, don’t panic! The comments in the JS panel will guide you step by step.
	Start by reading through the code, then try changing data or adding new items to see how the page updates automatically 🔄.
</p>

<p>
	If you get stuck, <em>read the MDN and React docs first</em> 📖 (links are included), experiment, and then ask for help 🙋.
</p>

<p>
	In the lower corner of this window, open the <strong>Console</strong> 💻 if it’s not already visible.
	And don’t forget to <strong>Fork</strong> this pen 🔗 — it’ll save your work to your own CodePen dashboard.
