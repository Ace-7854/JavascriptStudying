# JavascriptStudying
### Where is material provided?
The material is provided by lecturer at Bournemouth University, i post my results here for solutions for colleagues/classmates, as well as evidence for completion of weekly work.
The material is provided through <a href="https://codepen.io">Codepen</a>, thus may not run as it hasn't been ran through a standard IDE like VS Code. 
### Not just JS
This will start to go through to React.JS (front-end) and express.JS(back-end) through vite, so do expect as such. Week 1-2 is basics of JS, week 3 onwards leans into react and rest is advanced react.
